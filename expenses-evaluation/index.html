            <p> Critique another studentâ€™s Expenses App </p>
            <p>Perform a heuristic evaluation of the app you selected, following the methodology described in class.
                Descriptions of issues should use the vocabulary discussed in class, not subjective assessments like
                "this is hard to use" or "this is confusing". Use the suggested report format from the slides. Going
                beyond LES, label each issue with one of the categories from either Nielsen's Heuristics) (details) or
                Tognazzini's First Principles (details).</p>

            <p>Report 4 issues fitting 4 distinct categories in the list of heuristics you have chosen (Nielsen or Tog).
                Do not report cosmetic flaws, nor flaws of low severity if there are flaws of high severity. If your
                chosen app is so good that you cannot find 4 flaws, report instead on particularly notable positive
                contributions to usability, in the same format.</p>

            <p>Overall this app is a very pleasing user experience. This app fails Nielsen's heuristic principle of
                <strong>Constency and Standards</strong>, due to its lack of otimization for web usage. The page doesn't
                stretch out
                horizontally, as pages optimized for web usage should and uses a more rectangular framing for the app.
                The layout is not adaptable to horizontal screens, leading to html issues down the road. One apparent
                case is in the picture above, where all the details text is cramped up and nearly impossible to read
            </p>
            <p>Another of Nielsen's heuristics that fails is the <strong>Visibility of System Status</strong>. The
                accounts don't get
                updated. No feedback to the user can imply a non-functional app, even if the spreadsheet does get
                updated. It is unclear if this is always the case, or if these are isolated instances.</p>
            <p><strong> Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</strong>, another one of Neilson's principles also fails.
                There's an unecessary horizontal scroll and the content becomes off centered when it's interacted with.
                Horizontal scroll bars are to be avoided whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it's important to mention how aesthetically pleasing this app is as well as how easy it is for
                users to interact and learn how to use the app. Neilson's <strong>Aesthetic & Minimalist Design</strong>
                principle is portrayed wonderfully in this app. The design is simple, but beautiful and user friendly. 
                The buttons given constant feedback, adding a lot to the design aspect of this project.
