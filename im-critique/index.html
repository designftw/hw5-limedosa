            <p> Pick 3 instant messaging UIs. Compare these UIs in the three usability dimensions (Learnability,
                Efficiency, Safety) and graphic design.

            <p>Now that we have learned some CSS and graphic design principles, time to play with it!</p>
            <p>On the website you created for <a href="../hw1#ex2">HW1 Exercise 2</a>, add a &quot;portfolio&quot; page
                listing the apps you've worked on so far as part of this class.
                Each listing must (as a minimum) have a title, screenshot or video, and a description.</p>
            <p>Add a stylesheet on your website, that applies the design principles we've learned in class (proximity,
                alignment, contrast/hierarchy, repetition).
                You should <strong>use grid layout at least twice</strong> across the website (e.g. overall page layout
                and portfolio listing).</p>
            <p>Your HTML will be <strong>evaluated anew</strong> as part of the assignment, which gives you chance to
                fix all the problems that were flagged for you in assignment 1.
                Or you can redo the entire website if you wish. Either way, pay attention to using correct structure and
                semantic elements.</p>

            <p>We have anonymized a selection of the Expenses App submissions from HW3 and made them available for you
                to critique and improve.
                You can find <a href="https://designftw-hw.netlify.app/hw3/expenses/">the list here</a>.</p>
            <p><a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YyTHjgl6FHb6VxbG1wyPvnt5uOcufxm_UikhP3Mb1lM/edit?usp=sharing">Sign
                    up here</a> to critique one of the apps
                by entering your GitHub username next to the app you will improve.</p>
            <p>Some rules to follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You cannot select your own app. Please click through the app before selecting it and make sure it's
                    not your own.</li>
                <li>Do not select the same app as someone else, unless there are no other apps left.
                    In other words, do not fill in the &quot;Student 2&quot; column if there are still apps left in the
                    &quot;Student 1&quot; column.
                    The spreadsheet itself tries to enforce this too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Perform a heuristic evaluation of the app you selected,
                following the methodology <a
                    href="https://designftw.mit.edu/lectures/heuristic-eval/#heuristic-evaluation">described in
                    class</a>.
                Descriptions of issues should use the vocabulary discussed in class, not subjective assessments like
                &quot;this is hard to use&quot; or &quot;this is confusing&quot;.
                Use the <a href="https://designftw.mit.edu/lectures/heuristic-eval/#suggested-report-format">suggested
                    report format</a> from the slides.
                Going beyond LES, label each issue with one of the categories from either <a
                    href="https://designftw.mit.edu/lectures/heuristic-eval/#nielsen-heuristics">Nielsen's
                    Heuristics</a>)
                (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">details</a>)
                or <a href="https://designftw.mit.edu/lectures/heuristic-eval/#togs-first-principles">Tognazzini's First
                    Principles</a> (<a href="http://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-interaction-design/">details</a>).</p>
            <p>Report 4 issues fitting 4 <strong>distinct categories</strong> in the list of heuristics you have chosen
                (Nielsen or Tog).
                Do not report cosmetic flaws, nor flaws of low <a
                    href="https://designftw.mit.edu/lectures/heuristic-eval/#severity-ratings">severity</a> if there are
                flaws of high severity.
                If your chosen app is so good that you cannot find 4 flaws, report instead on particularly notable
                <strong>positive</strong> contributions to usability, in the same format.</p>
            <p>You may <strong>not</strong> discuss your app with others who are evaluating it, nor share the feedback
                you receive on it from the graders, until this exercise is complete.</p>

            <p>You will receive feedback on your expenses app by Friday of this week. Fix up your app to address
                problems it identifies.
                It will be graded according to exactly the same criteria as in hw3.
                If you are satisfied with your previous grade, you can skip submitting (leave the directory empty) and
                you'll get the same grade again (scaled appropriately)</p>
