            <p> Pick 3 instant messaging UIs. Compare these UIs in the three usability dimensions (Learnability,
                Efficiency, Safety) and graphic design.
            </p>

        <section id="ex1">
            <h3 id="ex1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ex1">Whatsapp: </a></h3>
            <p>Sample text message:
            <p><img src="hw5.png" alt="sample text" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsapp is a popular instant messaging app with a large following worldwide, but a significantly more
                minute following in the United States. In the picture above, I've shown what Whatsapp's web application
                interface looks like. The UI is simple, modern, and doesn't take away from the purpose of the app; to
                send messages.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Learnability:</strong>
            <p>In terms of learnability, whatsapp is extremely easy to use. Its texting features are all within
                proximity. This strategic proximity allows users to explore all the app's features. The video call and
                phone call features are also grouped. The messages are all on the left and visible at all times.
                Overall, this platform allows learning its interface very easy for new users. </p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong>
            <p>Adding on, Whatsapp is extremely efficient. It works perfectly in both desktops(like the screenshot
                shows) as well as phones. It shows when users are online as well as the exact time they were last
                active. The active feature is extremely accurate. It shows when a message was delivered, read, and when
                it wasn't received. </p>
            <p><strong>Safety: </strong></p>
            <p>Whatsapp is extremely safe, since it uses end to end encryption, meaning only the person sending the
                message and the person receiving the message have access to their texts. It's absolute
                <strong>privacy</strong>. You also need two factor authentication to log into whatsapp.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Graphic Design: </strong></p>
            <p>Whatsapp has very minimalist graphic design, with a beige background for texts that can be costumized to
                be an image, a pre-set background offered by Whatsapp, or a color picked by the user. This allows
                complete control over how the app looks to the user. One feature to note is its ability to show IOS
                emojis even in non-IOS devices(including non-iphones and non-Mac desktops).Lastly, users can pick a profile picture. </p>
            <div class="deliverable">
                <p><strong>Whatsapp rating:</strong> EXCELLENT!!!</p>
            </div>

        <section id="ex2">
            <h3 id="ex2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ex2">Slack: </a></h3>
            <p>Sample text message:
            <p><img src="slack.png" alt="sample text" width="40%" height="40%"></p>
            </p>
            <p> Slack is a messaging app used by professionals and students, usually with the intent of not having to
                send phone text messages.</p>
            <p><strong>Learnability: </strong></p>
            <p>Slack is not easy to learn by any means. There is such an over-abundance of features that they may
                confuse users. Its interface isn't very beginner friendly and it's hard adjusting to what the features
                are and do. This interface is also custumizable like Whatsapp!</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency: </strong></p>
            <p>Slack is amazing for group collaboration. It's interface allows users to send not only messages, but pdfs
                and other large attachments as well. </p>
            <p><strong>Safety: </strong></p>
            <p>Slack is very safe. It uses encryption like Whatsapp to protect user's privacy and conversations. Slack uses two factor authentication. </p>
            <p><strong>Graphic Design: </strong></p>
            <p>Since users can customize their slacks, Slack gives people the chance to opt in for their preffered design. Users can also pick a profile picture.</p>
            <div class="deliverable">
                <p><strong>Slack rating: </strong> Good</p>
                </p>

        <section id="ex3">
            <h3 id="ex3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ex3">iMessage: </a></h3>
            <p>Sample text message:
            <p><img src="imess.jpg" alt="sample text" width="20%" height="20%">v</p>

            <p><strong>Learnability: </strong></p>
            <p>It's quite easy and almost second nature for most people who've been using IOS products for a while. Unlike a lot of Apple's other more complex features, their messaging app is actually very learnable. </p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency: </strong></p>

            <p><strong>Safety: </strong></p>

            <p><strong>Graphic Design: </strong></p>

            <div class=deliverable>
